      <p style="height:16em">Located in Upstate, New York, Lake George has been attracting summer tourists for the generations. The nostalgic arcades and picturesque waterfront dining makes the town attractive and enjoyable for people of all ages. Most tourists spend their days walking the sidewalks and lying on the sand, but there are activities that suit every personality type. The quaint parks is filled with wild roller coasters, lazy rivers, and games. Lake George's dreamlike mountain landscape and sailboats make the whole town and will impress people who enjoy spending time outdoors.</p>

      <p style="height:16em">The first season introduces the six main characters: Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler, and Ross. Rachel arrives at Central Perk after running away from her wedding to her fianc√© Barry and moves into an apartment with her friend Monica from high school. Ross, who has had a crush on Rachel since the two of them were in high school, constantly attempts to tell her how he feels about her. However, many obstacles stand in his way, such as the fact that he is expecting a baby with his lesbian ex-wife, Carol. Joey is shown to be a bachelor and struggling actor, while Phoebe works as a masseuse and portrays a sort of "crazy" attribute to her personality based on her troubles as a child after her mother committed suicide.</p>

      <p style="height:16em">Glamorous, nautical Long Island has many quaint beach and tourist towns that attract thousands each summer and become vacant during the winter. Montauk is one of the most popular, as it is known for its sandy ocean beach, charming seaside town, and yearly Shark Tournaments. The 32nd Annual Shark Tournament will be held on June 14th. If you visit Montauk, I would suggest staying at a hotel out of the way to save money. Some other fun, beatiful Long Island beach towns include: Southampton, Port Jefferson, Sag Harbor and Greenport. </p>
