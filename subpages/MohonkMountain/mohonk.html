    <hr/>
    <p style="width:95%; padding:1em;"> The historic resort is located on the shore of Lake Mohonk, which is half of a mile (800 m) long and 60 feet (18 m) deep. The main structure, which was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986,[2] was built by Quaker twin brothers Albert and Alfred Smiley between 1869 and 1910.[4]

The property has been owned and operated by descendants of the Smiley brothers since 1869. The Smiley brothers envisioned a peaceful retreat where people could enjoy the beauty of nature in a truly spectacular setting. From its earliest days, the resort has maintained values of stewardship, reflection, and renewal.

From 1883 to 1916, annual conferences took place at Mohonk Mountain House, sponsored by Albert Smiley, to improve the living standards of Native American Indian populations.[5][6][7] These meetings brought together government representatives of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the House and Senate committees on Indian Affairs, as well as educators, philanthropists, and Indian leaders to discuss the formulation of policy. The 22,000 records from the 34 conference reports are now at the library of Haverford College for researchers and students of American history.[8]

The hotel hosted the Lake Mohonk Conference on International Arbitration between 1895 and 1916,[9] which was instrumental in creating the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, Netherlands.[10] Those conference papers were donated by the Smiley Family to Swarthmore College for future research.[9]

The house was given a National Historic Landmark designation in 1986, and a United Nations Environment Programme Award in 1994 in honor of "125 years of stewardship". According to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, "Through its buildings and roads, its land, and its spirit, Mohonk exemplifies America's history and culture. Mohonk has since managed to maintain its 19th century character into the 21st century."[11] In the 21st century, the resort also retains an emphasis on eco-friendly, environmentally green practices.

Bonticou Crag in the Mohonk Preserve
Headquarters of the not-for-profit Mohonk Preserve are in Gardiner, New York. Most of the land is in the town of Gardiner, but there is also land in the towns of Marbletown, Rosendale, New Paltz, and Rochester. Preserve lands extend for nearly 8 miles (13 km) from Rosendale to Millbrook Mountain.

More than 75% of the Preserve's funding comes from contributions, memberships and investments. Grants from land conservation organizations, including some from the New York State Conservation Partnership Program, and funds from the state's Environmental Protection Fund amount to 23% of income. It was the first land trust established on the northern Shawangunk Ridge.

The Preserve's mission is to protect the Shawangunk Mountains by inspiring people to care for, enjoy, and explore the natural world. To accomplish its mission, the Preserve conducts programs in four key areas - environmental education, serving both school children and adults; land protection, saving high-priority land on the ridge; land stewardship, balancing the protection of land and wildlife with opportunities for recreation; and scientific research, creating a "living laboratory" on the land. The land is home to more than 1,400 plant and animal species, including the peregrine falcon and 2,000 acres (810 ha) of rare dwarf pitch pine. Restricted deer hunting is allowed with the aim of preventing ecological damage due to overbrowsing.

There is a per-person day fee for cycling and rock climbing. Annual memberships are available. Free one-month memberships were offered to Ulster County residents in the spring and again in the fall of 2014.[5] Hours of operation are from sunrise to one hour past sunset.[2]

Minnewaska State Park Preserve adjoins the Mohonk Preserve lands to the south, and protects another 12,000 acres (49 km2) of former property of another member of the Smiley family as a state park.

  <h3 style="width:100%; padding:1em;"> Tourist destination</h3>
  <hr/>
  <p style="width:95%; padding:1em;"> Situated on the rail line halfway between New York City and Montreal, Lake George attracted the era's rich and famous by the late 19th and early 20th century. Members of the Roosevelt, van Rensselaer, Vanderbilt, Rockefeller and Whitney families visited its shores. The Fort William Henry Hotel, in what is now Lake George Village, and The Sagamore in Bolton Landing opened at this time to serve tourists. The wealthiest visitors were more likely to stay with their peers at their private country estates.[citation needed] The Silver Bay YMCA on Lake George was constructed in 1900. It has since evolved into a summer family camp, serving several hundred organizations and tourists every summer. Since 1913, on the East Shore of Lake George, YMCA Camp Chingachgook has hosted thousands of guests every summer.[citation needed]
 Lake George is accessible by car via Interstate 87 and by air from Albany International Airport, which is about 45 miles (72 km) away. Today, Lake George remains a tourist destination, resort center, and summer colony. A popular activity in the Lake George area is hot air ballooning. One of the nation's oldest gathering of hot air balloons occurs every September in nearby Glens Falls.
