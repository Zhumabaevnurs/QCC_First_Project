    <p style="background-color: rgba(208,180,123 , 0.6);" style="width:95%; padding:1em;"> Montauk, New York, is a village at the east end of the Long Island peninsula. It’s known for its beaches, like Ditch Plains, with its strong Atlantic surf. At the peninsula’s tip, Montauk Point State Park is home to the 1796 Montauk Point Lighthouse. A museum in the keeper’s house displays historical documents signed by George Washington. Camp Hero State Park, once a military base, has WWII bunkers and a radar tower.

    Montauk has more hotels and motels than any other Suffolk County destination. Some are small family owned establishments, others luxury resorts. Now that the summer season is over, many hotels and motels offer off-season specials. Check with each hotel for off-season rates and promotions.

    Montauk’s season is generally defined as the last weekend in June to Labor Day weekend. However, most businesses begin to open in April and May, and many do not close until November or December.

    For information about lodging, select an area of Montauk listed in the main navigation. All hotels, motels, and B&B’s in that area are listed. Download the Montauk map to view the location of these areas in Montauk.

  <hr/>
  <p style="background-color: rgba(208,180,123 , 0.6);" style="width:95%; padding:1em;"> A 200-year-old lighthouse serves as a beacon for the Long Island town of Montauk, where fishing, beachcombing, kayaking and surfing vie for your attention. Pack a camera and binoculars for seal watching walks in Montauk Point State Park during the winter. Second House, a 1700s cottage built for East Hampton shepherds, adds to the local history. Summer season brings live music to the town's pubs and cafes. Hither Hills State Park provides access to ocean swimming, a 40-acre freshwater pond and camp sites.
